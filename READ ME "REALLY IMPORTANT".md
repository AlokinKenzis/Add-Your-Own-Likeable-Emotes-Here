# Twitch-Autocorrect-Github
Used for autocorrection of text for emotes, abbreviations and grammar correction.

BEFORE ANYTHING (This app is not a malware, i have no evil or bad thoughts or doings so i can harm someone's computer, This app is simply here to help you chat easier on twitch
with chat emotes,

//  N   O   T   E

THE APP CANNOT BE OPEN WHILE ANY GAME WITH AN ANTICHEAT IS ON!!!!
DO NOT OPEN IT WHILE A MULTIPLAYER GAME WITH AN ANTICHEAT IS ON, OR YOU MAY BE BANNED!!!!

(Many 10year old kids use this app to create cheats, which is absolutely stupid, and in such, im pretty sure that every anticheat ever blocked this software from being used
in their games).

In that regard i did some safety measures, and that the APP can only open if the BROWSER is ON, and the APP will close when the BROWSER is OFF too. (browser being the iternet
explorer you're currently using, that being "chrome" or "opera" or "mozilla" or any other browser)

Now that that's done, you're all fine and dandy.

Before installing the zip/rar file, you need to download autohotkey itself so the app may work >>>>>> https://www.autohotkey.com

Press the green labeled Download button, then press the Green labeled Download Current Version, Go through the install process, and install the autohotkey app.

After downloading autohotkey, go to the release section in my github page, and download the latest zip/rar file.
///
Inside the zip/rar file, there are 3 apps, use the one corespoding to your browser, Example (So if you use opera, you would choose Twitch-Autocorrectoor 1.01 Opera.ahk)
Take the file out to your dekstop and now you're ready.

Things you might not know

1.The APP is not opening fsm reason
-The APP will only open if the corespoding browser is open too, take out the correct APP from the zip/rar file, open it when your BROWSER is open too, and it will open too, in
the same regard, if the browser is closed, the app will close too ( for safety measures )
