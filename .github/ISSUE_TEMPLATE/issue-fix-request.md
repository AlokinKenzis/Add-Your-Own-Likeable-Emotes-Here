Frequent issues that may occur :

1.The app is not opening
-The app will only open if the browser is open too, there are three different apps for three different browsers (opera, mozilla, and chrome), Use the same app that coresponds to your browser, if you use the wrong one, the app will not open (Because of security reasons)
